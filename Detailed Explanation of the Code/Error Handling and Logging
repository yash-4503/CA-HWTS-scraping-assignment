Purpose:
The solution logs key events (e.g., successful data loads, errors during scraping) to the console. This logging makes it easier to troubleshoot issues or understand the progress of the script.

Key Points:

Errors in loading CSVs or scraping details are captured and logged.

The script does not crash on encountering an error for one EPA_ID; it logs the error and continues with the next.
